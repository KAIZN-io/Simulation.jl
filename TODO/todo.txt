implement Docker:
Docker engine runs on Linux systems. Docker is an open-source project based on 
Linux containers. It uses the features based on the Linux Kernel. 

The slogan is, “build once, run anywhere”!

Docker allows you build an environment/infrastructure push up an image of it to 
a docker repository and have someone, a world away, pull down your docker image,
and have it run exactly the same way it ran on your computer.
The reason this is possible is because of the concept of containers. You can put 
say mysql in one container, apache in another, and php in yet another one all
wrapped up in a host container running a variation of linux you like. Have the 
php container pull in php code from a git repository, and set it up so that 
docker spins up a working environment with your app once you run the command to 
initialize everything.
