# Dockerized ProjectQ with web interface
In this repository we develop the code needed to run ProjectQ in docker and exposing the configuration via a web interface.
	
## How to use
run in terminal:

    docker-compose up

Wait for everything to be up and running, then open your browser and go to: [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)

## Perspective
This software should be the core for the construction of "Design of Experiment" (DoE)
