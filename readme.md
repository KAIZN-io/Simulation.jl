# Bachelor Thesis - Software
This repository enables you to simulate the hog, ion, volume and combined model presented in my thesis.

**annotation:** This software is only in a beta-version. The whole used analysis of the models is not implemented yet
but the code is accessible.
	
## How to use
Download [docker](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community) for your system and install it.

After that, run in terminal:

    docker-compose up


Wait for everything to be up and running, then open your browser and go to: [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)

## Perspective
This software should be the core for the construction of *Design of Experiment* (DoE)
