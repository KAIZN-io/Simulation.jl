\section{Discussion}
Discussion: It is assumed that there are not any temperature gradient which would results in a heat flux.\\\\
Currently, only the proton and the potassium transport are ATP driven. It is known that $Na^+$ is also excluded by the Ena1p pump, which extrudes potassium. A general extension of the implemented membran transport processes could benifits the insight of then model in response of a external stimulus.\\\\
An implementation of the CWI pathways could further improve the information value of the combined model.\\\\
Another further work aspect is the improvement of the model vision control with the help of a database.
